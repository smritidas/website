While studying for interviews, I decided to take a break and wandered outside into the bright afternoon summer sun. After all, there’s only so much time one can spend grinding Leetcode in one day.

That did get me thinking though. Scanning the internet there’s plenty of books, articles and blogs written about the tech job search process. These pieces cover topics ranging from best practices while interviewing (be enthusiastic and honest) to optimizing your LinkedIn profile (recruiters look for keywords)to how to study/code efficiently (Blind 75). There’s also many articles on how the process is broken (I will cover this in a future post). 

On the other hand, there aren’t a lot of articles on taking care of oneself while interviewing. I figured there has to be ways to handle the overwhelm and do this is in a way that’s reduces stress, anxiety and worries? I asked around for tips and listened to a few talks and these are a few things that I’ve been practicing:

- People: I didn’t realize the importance of having supportive people around me until I embarked on a career in tech. In terms of interviews, I have an accountability buddy (or two) whom I update once a week. It feels nice to have people who have gone through the tech interview process, can fully emphasize (CodeSignal is tough) and believe in you unequivocally. 
- Pace yourself: Before starting the job hunt, I made a list of all the things I needed to accomplish (study questions, rewrite resume etc.). I realized as overwhelming as the tasks felt, I didn’t have to accomplish them all in one sitting. Instead, I use a notebook to make a list of top three priorities per day, based on priority. I then break the work down into chunks and go from there. 
- Fun stuff: I also keep a list of fun things that I can do after getting the aforementioned tasks done. It gives something to look forward too. Examples are things like plans with friends, going for a walk, podcasts, guitar practice, or lastly, sitting in my garden (hence the title). 
- Deep breaths: I get anxious before getting on calls with strangers. A tip I learned was to take a breath in for 5, breathe out for 5 until I felt calm. 
- Finally, rejection doesn’t define me and I take the process as a learning experience. I try to keep other companies in the pipeline so that if one doesn’t work out, I can focus on the next opportunity. 

Interviews are tough, but I remind myself that they are doable as well. As the quote goes *“the cave you fear to enter, holds the treasure you seek”* Joseph Campbell
