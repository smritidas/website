I’m currently in a training course for my first Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the Professional Cloud Architect certification. I have to say, so far, I am finding the material enticing but daunting. In that spirit, I wanted to write what about my study plan to pass the certification. 

The main topics in cloud to familiarize myself with are database, compute services, storage and networking. I’m admittedly having trouble wrapping my head around all the terms. To alleviate this problem, I keep a running list of terms and their definitions in a document. I look up anything I don’t understand and keep a definition of it, for quick access. On top of that, I’ve made flash cards with the name of the service on one side, and the notes on the other side. 

As for ways to learn the material, I have a subscription to Google Cloud Skills Boost. I can’t say it’s my favourite way to study though. I’m one of those people that learns best from books. I find books to be more effective because with a book, I can close out the outside world. A book has no notifications to distract me.

My two favourite books so far are Priyanka Vergadia’s “Visualizing Google Cloud” and Dan Sullivan’s “Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide”. Reading through “Visualizing Google Cloud” I’m having a lot of lightbulb moments as I’m a visual learner. As for Sullivan’s book, I like it because it breaks down bigger topics into smaller digestible pieces. The book also has sample quizzes which have helped me really focus on gaps in my learning. A caveat is the sample quizzes are much easier than the questions on the sample exam. 


On the topic of same study exams, Google has questions readily available. I’m going through a few questions each day to make sure I am used to the style. Something else I’m doing in the lead up to the exam is making sure there are no mystery topics. 

Finally, Google also has an official study guide available which highlights what the exam will cover. The first time I went over sample test questions, I was dismayed. Slowly but surely though they are starting to click. 

I’m trying my best not to panic too. I’m not going to study 40 hours a week, but keep it reasonable. I’ll write more study tips in my next post.
