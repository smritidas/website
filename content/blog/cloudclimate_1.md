It’s fascinating to watch the rise of climate tech companies over the past few years. It’s no secret that climate change is a major problem and watching the myriad of companies, especially in tech, rise to the challenge is fascinating to watch. 

As I study for cloud certifications, I’ve been looking at sustainability as incorporated within some of the major cloud providers. Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure) and Google (GCP) (the biggest three per market share) have all outlined their commitments to environmental causes. Amongst these are impressive pledges ranging from committing to powering their data centers with renewable energy (all three providers) to keeping hardware in use longer (AWS). At the same time, GCP says they are working towards using carbon free energy sources by 2030. Finally, Microsoft outlines a number of environmental projects, such as reforestation efforts, in various places around the world. 

Cloud technology also can be in other ways too. GCP, Azure and AWS offer services that enable users to track their carbon footprints based on the services used. These allow businesses to monitor their greenhouse gas emissions enabling them to work towards lowering their carbon footprints. As I study and become better acquainted with these services, I’ll be writing more about providers' tools, and how they compare. 

Another potential use is better data analysis using AI technology. Using the cloud allows for data from satellites, sensors and other sources to be collected, processed and analyzed quickly. The results can be used to warn of impending trouble e.g. forest fires. 
Google recently announced a similar technology that can be used to forecast floods (Floodhub).  

That’s a quick overview of some of the technology's benefits. On the other hand there are some major environmental concerns regarding the data centers dotted around the globe. These centers use a lot of energy (and water resources) to remain cool, thus greatly increasing their environmental footprint. 

Finally, I’m uncertain about if all these environmental pledges are genuinely helpful? After all, they are made by corporations and if they don’t meet their goals, there’s no laws holding them accountable. How sustainability will play out, over the next decade, remains to be seen. 

Although I am skeptical I’m looking into investigating more and will write more in the next part, forthcoming.
